Qui, qui nous hante
Oh, reviens soleil, soleil
Qui, qui nous hante
Oh, reviens

Highs and lows
I put you through a lot, I know
Highs and lows
Still, you never let me go

Ain't nobody bigger than the program
Till you bigger than the program
Climax fast to a slow jam
Toxic love, chemical romance
Somebody I love finally loves me back
Before I break your heart I'll have a heart attack
We separated, but we made it back
We gonna stay attached till we fade to black

Highs and lows, highs and lows
I put you through a lot, I know
Highs and lows, highs and lows
Still, you never let me go
